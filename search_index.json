The aim of this problem set is to implement the F-test for joint hypothesis testing and to compare the performance of the F-test if the model assumptions upon which the test statistics are derived, are violated. 11.1 Implementing the F-statistic Assume initially that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}=\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&amp;0&amp;0\\end{matrix}\\right)\\) and that \\(\\varepsilon_i\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,10)\\). Calculate the OLS estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), implement the F-Statistic and compare the value of the F-Statistic with the relevant quantile from the F-distribution. Does the global Null hold? 11.2 Simulation Study Write the code above into a function that returns a logical expression whether the Null was rejected. Repeat this calculation 1000 times and record your results in a vector. What is the expected number of rejected hypotheses in this scenario? Summarize and discuss your results. 11.3 Simulation study: Violating model assumptions Re-write the function above to include the option for simulating heteroskedasticity. Come up with a suitable way to simulate heteroskedasticity in the model and run the simulation above again. What is your expectation? "]
