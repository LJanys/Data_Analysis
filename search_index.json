Objective of the course Review basic methods and models from econometrics and implement them in R. Goal: Being able to evaluate different methods based on their finite sample properties 1.1 List of Topics Multiple linear regression Nonparametric Density Estimation Nonparametric Regression Maximum Likelihood Quantifying Uncertainty: Bootstrap 1.2 Methods 1.2.1 Data We will use (in most cases) simulated data: allows us to control the data generating process (normality, homoskedasticity, linearity, etc.). manipulate properties of the DGP to evaluate different estimators 1.2.2 Tools To follow along you need to download the newest version of R and the editor RStudio https://cran.r-project.org https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ Script: Theory and embedded Rcode, newest version always available on E-Campus. An Example: Density estimation Suppose that \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). Compare a randomly chosen sample from a normal distribution with the theoretical values of the normal distribution. N=100# Number of observations in the draw x&lt;-rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=1) z=seq(min(x),max(x),le=100) hx&lt;-dnorm(z) plot(density(x),main=&quot;&quot;,ylim=c(0,0.45)) lines(z,hx, col=&quot;red&quot;) 1.3 Exam There will be an exam that will last 60 Minutes. The exam will contain theoretical questions about the models we discussed, empirical questions and some chunks of code to be discussed. 1.4 Timetable 11.10, 16.10, 18.10: Introduction to R. Lecture on 11.10. and 16.10.: for complete beginners. If you already have knowledge of R, you do not need to come. Every Wednesday: Theory and Model. Every Friday: Exercise and Programming.
