Logarithm log(...,10) Logarithm with Base 10 abs() absolute value round(...,x) rounding to x decimals. pi exp(1) Eulers number sin(),cos(),tan() trigonemetric functions min(), max() returns the lowest/highest value of a vector/matrix Enter the following calculations and understand the command 1.8+2 1.8-2 1.8*2 1.8/2 2+2*3 (2+2)*3 2^3 8^(1/3) 3^2 9^0.5 2^2*2+2 2^(2*((0.2+0.3)*(1+2)))+4 sqrt(2) exp(1) exp(2) log(7.389056) log(exp(3)) log(100,10) abs(1.8-2) round(sqrt(2),2) round(sqrt(2),4) pi sin(pi/2) sin(pi/2) sin(pi) tan(pi) x=2+3i y=4+1i x y x+y x*y Attention: 1.224606e-16 is interpreted as \\(1.224606 \\times 10^{-16}\\). This is often exactly zero, but for internal memory purposes (R only has up to 16 decimals), can be a rounding mistake. "]
