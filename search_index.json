Test each coefficient for significance and record the number of coefficients that are estimated to be significant at the 5% level. What would be the expected number? 12.2 Simulation Study: Size Write the code above into a function that returns the sum of significant coefficients and repeat this for varying sample sizes, ranging from 500 and increase to 50000 in an interval spacing of your choice. Record your results in a vector. What is the expected number of rejected hypotheses in this scenario? Plot the number of rejected hypotheses against the sample size. Summarize your results. 12.3 Simulation study: Power Now suppose that we have a univariate \\(y_i=\\beta x_i+\\varepsilon_i\\) and only one regressor \\(x_i\\) with a standard normal error term. In a simulation study, calculate the number of observations that are required to correctly reject the Null in at least 80% of the cases for \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) when \\(\\beta=0.1\\). Check how much increasing the treatment effect by 0.1 (by increasing the dose for example) might be ``cheaper’’ in terms of required sample size. "]
