# Problem Set 5: Climate Week

The goal of this mini-project is to explore some "real" data and to analyze weather data from the German Weather Data is compatible with a climate change hypothesis.


## Data 

The data can be obtained at 
https://www.dwd.de/EN/climate_environment/cdc/cdc_node.html

and can be downloaded as a csv file. 

## Tools

- read csv files into R: read.csv("my_data.csv")
- plot(x,y), line(x,y), abline(a,b).
- three dimensional plots: persp(x,y,z)
- fancy plots: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org

## Analysis

When analyzing the data using hypothesis testing, linear regression, plots etc. remember the assumptions about the data structure etc. 

A good data workflow involves plotting and visualizing the data prior to analyzing the data.
