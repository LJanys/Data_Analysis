# Course Overview {#intro}

Also a test

This course is an introduction to data analysis using the programming language **R** and the editor R-Studio.

**Objective of the course** 

Review basic methods and models from econometrics and implement them in **R**. 

**Goal: Being able to evaluate different methods based on their finite sample properties**

## List of Topics{#list}

- Multiple linear regression
- Nonparametric Density Estimation 
- Nonparametric Regression
- Maximum Likelihood
- Quantifying Uncertainty: Bootstrap 

## Methods{#method}

### Data{#data} 

We will use (in most cases) simulated data:  

- allows us to control the data generating process (normality, homoskedasticity, linearity, etc.). 
- manipulate properties of the DGP to evaluate different estimators 

### Tools{#tools}

To follow along you need to download the newest version of **R** and the editor **RStudio**

- https://cran.r-project.org
- https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/
- Script: Theory and embedded Rcode, newest version always available on E-Campus.

**An Example: Density estimation**

Suppose that $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Compare a randomly chosen sample from a normal distribution with the theoretical values of the normal distribution. 

```{r}
N=100# Number of observations in the draw
x<-rnorm(N, mean=0, sd=1)
z=seq(min(x),max(x),le=100)
hx<-dnorm(z)
plot(density(x),main="",ylim=c(0,0.45)) 
lines(z,hx, col="red")

```



## Exam 

There will be an exam that will last 60 Minutes. The exam will contain theoretical questions about the models we discussed, empirical questions and some chunks of code to be discussed. 

## Timetable
